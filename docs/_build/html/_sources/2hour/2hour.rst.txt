Two (2) Hour F5 Distributed Cloud Labs
==========================================

Welcome to the Archived F5 Distributed Cloud labs.

The following labs and exercises were created in 2-hour lab formats. These labs are 
based off of the 4-hour lab formats provided in F5 Agility Conferences.

They were developed to provide a shorter format of key concepts allowing for attendees 
to configure and troubleshoot key use cases.  For more detailed and extended labs, please
refer to the four-lab formats available at https://clouddocs.f5.com/training/community/f5xc/html/.
