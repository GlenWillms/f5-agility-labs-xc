F5 Distributed Cloud 101 - WAF/WAAP Deeper Dive
=================================================

In this lab, attendees will take a deeper dive into F5 Web Application and API Protection (WAAP). Attendees will review WAAP Policy Frameworks, exercise configuration options, review security events and perform exclusion handling. Attendees will also explore Service Policy configuration and AI-driven BotDefense deployment configurations.

**Objective**

Using the instructions provided in these labs, create a WAF policy with default or custom attack types, enable threat campaigns, define bot protection settings, and attach that WAF to an HTTP load balancer to protect the app that load balancer serves. These instructions also include information on how to control responses from origin servers.
