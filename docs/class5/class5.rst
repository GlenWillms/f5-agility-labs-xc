F5 Distributed Cloud 301 - Introduction to Managed Kubernetes
=============================================================

This Lab environment highlights some of the basic concepts of F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) AppStack.

During the lab you will be emulating a customer that needs to deploy applications closer to the user. The goal is to understand the steps and requirements to place workloads in the F5 Distributed Cloud virtual Kubernetes implementation.

This class has one module and 3 primary labs and 2 optional. We're simply doing this to show the standard structure of a class/module/lab.

.. note:: It could be simpler to throw all the content in one file but that
   would miss the point of showing how we currently use RST.
