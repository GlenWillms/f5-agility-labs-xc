Lab 1: Access the Shared Lab Environment
========================================

Previously you should have received an email to access the shared Distributed Cloud Lab Environment.

Start by logging into Distributed Cloud Console.  You should have previously received an email to create an account.


#. Please log into your assigned Distributed Cloud tenant. https://f5-xc-lab-mcn.console.ves.volterra.io 

    .. note:: The Distributed Cloud GUI has a relatively short timeout. This is not configurable. We have an enhancement request to allow this to be configured.

#. When you first login you will need to select your "persona"

   Enter your persona as "NetOps" and level as "Intermediate".  You can change these settings after logging in as well.

   Your persona will highlight workflows within F5 Distributed Cloud.  You will be able to access all services, but making use of
   personas can focus your view on particular tasks that are relevant to your role.

#. Several tooltips will appear.  You can close these out.

#. Click on "Account Settings" by expanding the "Account" icon in the top right of the screen and 
   clicking on "Account Settings"

#. Next click on "My Namespaces" and take note of the `adjective-animal` namespace that you have been assigned. This done using a dictionary index reference to dynamically create namespaces <adjective-animal>. Each student will have a unique namespace.

Please note this namespace as this will be required for future reference in the lab.  For example in this image "select-weasel" is the value that you should be used when prompted to create alert-krill.lab-mcn.f5demos.com.
